<h1>The best shows I have watched in 2024</h1>
<h2>- by Sarah Shaikh</h2>
<h3>1. 3 Body Problem</h3>
<p>This show was science fiction about aliens that are technologically very advanced than humans and are trying to save their planet. But when things don't go their way, they plan to invade Earth. </p>
<h3>2. Bridgerton</h3>
<p>Bridgerton has been one of my most fav shows for the past 3 years and that's not changing anytime soon. Even though Penelope isn't my most fav character, I still love her and Colin finally getting together.</p>
<h3>3. Alias Grace</h3>
<p>This show was about a "murderess" (as Grace Marks likes to call herself) who is charged with the murder of 2 people, her mistress whom she worked for and her man. Loved this show a lot as it highlights the past traumas that Grace has endured living with her father and provides great insight into her character. the ending, however, was the best imo.</p>
